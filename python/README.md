## Description

[PH Evaluator](https://github.com/HenryRLee/PokerHandEvaluator) is designed
for evaluating poker hands with more than 5 cards. Instead of traversing all
the combinations, it uses a perfect hash algorithm to get the hand strength
from a pre-computed hash table, which only costs very few CPU cycles and
considerably small memory (~100kb for the 7 card evaluation). With slight
modification, the same algorithm can be also applied to evaluating Omaha
poker hands.

## Installation

The library requires Python 3.

* from release on PyPI

  ```shell
  pip install phevaluator
  ```

* from source code

  ```shell
  pip install .
  ```

## Using the library

The main function is the `evaluate_cards` function.

```python
from phevaluator.evaluator import evaluate_cards

p1 = evaluate_cards("9c", "4c", "4s", "9d", "4h", "Qc", "6c")
p2 = evaluate_cards("9c", "4c", "4s", "9d", "4h", "2c", "9h")

# Player 2 has a stronger hand
print(f"The rank of the hand in player 1 is {p1}") # 292
print(f"The rank of the hand in player 2 is {p2}") # 236
```

The function can take both numbers and card strings (with a format like: 'Ah' or
'2C'). Usage examples can be seen in `examples.py`.

## Test

* The pre-calculated tables (`phevaluator.tables`) are tested by comparing them
  with the tables generated by test codes.
* The functionality of the evaluators is tested by comparing with the JSON files
  generated by the original C++ evaluator.
* The functionality of the other modules is tested by its purposes.

```shell
python3 -m unittest discover -v
```

## Contributing

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Python package of PHEvaluator!
To ensure a smooth contribution process, please follow the guidelines below.

### Requirements

* Python 3.8
* [Ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/) for linting and formatting
* [mypy](https://mypy-lang.org/) for type checking

### Code style

* Follow the [Black code style](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/the_black_code_style/current_style.html).
* Write type hints following [PEP 484](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0484/).
* Include docstrings following [PEP 257](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/).
* Lint and format code using `Ruff`.

### Development Setup

#### Option 1: Setup with pre-commit (recommended)

* Install `pre-commit`:

  ```shell
  pip install pre-commit
  ```

* Install `pre-commit` hooks:

  ```shell
  pre-commit install
  ```

#### Option 2: Setup without pre-commit

* Install `Ruff`:

  ```shell
  pip install ruff
  ```

* Install `mypy`:

  ```shell
  pip install mypy
  ```

### Checking Changes

You can install the package from the source code in `editable` mode:

```shell
pip install -e .
```

This allows the installed package to automatically reflect changes made in the `phevaluator`
folder.

### Committing Changes

The configurations for Ruff and mypy can be found in [pyproject.toml](pyproject.toml).

#### Option 1: Commit with pre-commit

When you commit your changes, `pre-commit` will automatically run the linters, formatters,
type checker, and unit tests.

#### Option 2: Commit without pre-commit

* Lint code with `Ruff`:

  ```shell
  ruff check
  ```

* Format code with `Ruff`:

  ```shell
  ruff format
  ```

* Type check with `mypy`:

  ```shell
  mypy .
  ```

* Run unit tests:

  ```shell
  python3 -m unittest discover -v
  ```

Please ensure that your code passes all the checks and tests before submitting a
pull request. If you have any questions, need further assistance, or want to report
a bug or suggest an enhancement, feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/HenryRLee/PokerHandEvaluator/issues).
